        This technical note explains what a financial restructuring of a company
        involves, differentiating it from other types of transactions which
        share similarities, such as operational restructurings or debt
        refinancings. It also explains the main financial tools generally used
        in financial restructuring deals, their advantages and main
        implementation principles.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the end of the note, the author includes a practical example of
        financial restructuring in a food processing company.
